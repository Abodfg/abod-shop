The AI engineer's work has been an iterative process, primarily focused on developing and refining the Abod Shop (formerly Abod Card) Telegram bot and its associated Telegram Web App (TWA). Initially, the project involved UI adjustments and payment system integration (Telegram Stars then reverted to a local dollar wallet). Recent efforts extensively addressed user feedback, including fixing persistent bot unresponsiveness, implementing comprehensive search features across the user bot, admin bot, and TWA, and overhauling the TWA's UI/branding to a Cyber/Tech Aesthetic. Crucially, the payment method management in the admin bot and the order fulfillment flow were made multi-step and robust. The latest task involves debugging a report generation issue where reports aren't sent due to an outdated bot token.

The Abod Shop is a Telegram bot and Web App for selling digital cards, aiming for a fast, modern Cyber/Tech Aesthetic. The TWA () must be the primary interface, displaying categorized products, featuring a functional purchase flow, and showing dollar wallet balance. Branding requires a consistent Abod Shop name, a specific logo, and an electric blue/bright orange color scheme with neon/glow effects. The payment system is a local dollar wallet, with admin-managed manual methods. TWA top-up requests redirect to the bot to display payment options. Key features include multi-language support (Arabic/English), unique order numbers with admin search, and product/category search in both user bot and TWA. Admin bot requires full management capabilities, user/order search (with execute/cancel options), a multi-step order completion process, and an image-based report generation/sending feature for users.

<code_architecture>

- ****: The core FastAPI backend handling all bot logic, API endpoints, and database interactions.
    - **Summary of importance:** Centralized control for user and admin bot interactions, including product management, user/order handling, payment methods, and report generation.
    - **Summary of changes:** Numerous modifications for admin bot functions (payment method CRUD, user/order search, multi-step order completion), user bot order history, and top-up flow.  generation logic was refined for consistency. Recent changes include  updates and fixing session data issues causing Error in order ID.
- ****: The Telegram Web App user interface.
    - **Summary of importance:** Provides the visual store experience for users within Telegram, essential for product display, search, and purchase.
    - **Summary of changes:** Extensively redesigned for the Abod Shop brand with specific color schemes, font styles, button effects (neon/glow), and product card aesthetics. Search functionality was added and debugged. Dollar balance display replaced the Telegram Stars balance.
- ****: Backend environment variables.
    - **Summary of importance:** Contains crucial configuration, including bot tokens and database connection strings.
    - **Summary of changes:** The  was updated to reflect the new user bot.
- ****: (New file) Python script using Pillow for generating image-based order reports.
    - **Summary of importance:** Essential for the new feature allowing users to receive visual order reports from the bot.
    - **Summary of changes:** Created and modified to include order details and code in the generated image report.
- ****: (New file) Placeholder for performance testing utilities.
    - **Summary of importance:** Will contain logic for generating and deleting dummy data for testing purposes.
    - **Summary of changes:** Created, but implementation details are not yet completed in the trajectory.
- ****: Python dependency list.
    - **Summary of changes:**  library was added to support image generation for reports.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement multi-language support (English portion).
- Implement performance testing with dummy data generation.
- Implement deletion of dummy users and orders from the admin bot.
- Enhance daily/monthly/yearly reports with filtering capabilities.
- Conduct a comprehensive bot check and optimize code for lightness.
- Integrate the provided logo (file_00000000b780620a8b9c13556b1896be.png) into the TWA UI.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several critical user complaints. The user reported that the report generation for clients () was stuck, not sending the image, which is a key new feature. Additionally, the user noted that the white color in the Telegram Web App's UI was unsuitable, and many buttons in the bot's list were unresponsive. They also requested a comprehensive system check and code optimization for a lightweight codebase ahead of an official launch.

The AI engineer has just completed the aesthetic adjustment for the TWA, changing the previously unsuitable white color in the UI to a more appropriate light gray () by performing  operations on  to update CSS variable usage. The very next, and current, task is to fix the stuck report generation functionality. The AI has identified the root cause: the  function in  is incorrectly using an outdated  instead of the recently provided and updated  for the new user bot. This is the immediate problem the AI is in the process of resolving.
