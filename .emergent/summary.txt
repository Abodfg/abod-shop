The AI engineer's work primarily revolved around enhancing the Abod Shop Telegram bot and its associated Telegram Web App (TWA). Initial efforts focused on crucial UI updates, migrating payment systems, fixing bot unresponsiveness, implementing comprehensive search, and overhauling the TWA's UI to a Cyber/Tech Aesthetic. Significant progress was made on report generation, backend optimization, and new features like guest user flows and Telegram SEO.

Throughout the trajectory, the AI engineer diligently addressed user feedback, which often involved debugging persistent issues on the TWA (e.g., product display, support links) and core bot functionalities (e.g., webhook registration, deep linking, button responsiveness). Key features added include a channel advertisement system with deep linking, click tracking, broadcast notifications, and robust security measures (rate limiting, IP whitelisting, anti-spam). A recurring challenge involved  not retaining backend URL configuration after being copied, requiring manual fixes. The trajectory concludes with several issues reported by the user, including unresponsive admin bot buttons, persistent category deletion failures, and rate limit adjustments, leading the AI to invoke a .

<product_requirements>
The Abod Shop is a Telegram bot and Web App designed for selling digital cards, emphasizing a fast, modern Cyber/Tech Aesthetic with an electric blue/bright orange color scheme. The TWA () is the primary interface, requiring categorized product display, a functional purchase flow, and dollar wallet balance visibility. Payment is handled via a local dollar wallet with admin-managed manual top-up methods, redirecting TWA requests to the bot.
Core features include:
- Multi-language support (Arabic/English).
- Unique order numbers with admin search.
- Product/category search in bot and TWA.
- Admin bot for full management, user/order search (execute/cancel), and multi-step order completion.
- Image-based order report generation.
- Telegram SEO, detailed product/category info, Menu Button/Mini App.
- Guest user purchase flow for non-Telegram users.
- **Added during trajectory:** Copyable account numbers in payment methods, a channel advertisement system with specific product deep links, ad scheduling, editable templates, click tracking and analytics for ads, broadcast notifications to all bot users, and enhanced security (rate limiting, IP whitelisting, anti-spam).

<code_architecture>

- ****:
    - **Importance:** Main backend logic for bot, TWA APIs, and database interactions.
    - **Changes:**
        - Fixed  usage and ensured correct  object referencing.
        - Implemented copyable account numbers for payment methods.
        - Added  and  MongoDB models.
        - Introduced Admin Bot menu options for Channel Ads and Broadcast to Users.
        - Implemented ad creation, template management, deep linking (), and sending ads to the Telegram channel.
        - Added deep link handling in  to direct users to specific products.
        - Implemented click tracking for ads (impression, click, purchase).
        - Added functionality to delete a category from a product (deactivation).
        - Integrated security features: FastAPI middleware for rate limiting, IP whitelisting for admin, and anti-spam for user messages.
        - Ensured automatic webhook registration on application startup to prevent bot unresponsiveness after restarts.
        - Corrected  import scope in .
        - Fixed various callback data mismatches and syntax errors during feature development.
- ****:
    - **Importance:** Core TWA UI.
    - **Changes:** Updated to include the Telegram channel link and fix support email/user support messages, ensuring consistency with .
- ****:
    - **Importance:** Static file for custom-domain-hosted TWA (GitHub Pages).
    - **Changes:**
        - Initial fix:  corrected from  to the explicit  to resolve product display issues on custom domain. This fix had to be re-applied multiple times due to  being copied over it.
        - Added logging for debugging product loading.
        - Integrated Telegram channel link and support fixes.
        - Added a Open Telegram Bot button to redirect users to the bot, opening the TWA.
- ****:
    - **Importance:** Backend environment variables.
    - **Changes:** Verified  and  were correctly sourced. Confirmed  was .
- ** (New)**:
    - **Importance:** Simple HTML page created to facilitate direct download of the latest TWA HTML file for the user.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement multi-language support (English portion).
- Implement performance testing with dummy data generation.
- Implement deletion of dummy users and orders from the admin bot.
- Enhance daily/monthly/yearly reports with filtering capabilities.
- Address persistent issues with admin bot buttons being unresponsive.
- Address persistent issues with category deletion still failing for the user.
- Fine-tune rate limiting: ensure it's disabled for funded customers and doesn't affect admin operations or cause slow responses/exceeded limits for regular users.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tackling a list of recurring and new issues reported by the user:
1.  **Rate Limiting:** The user complained about strict rate limits, causing slow bot responses (بطئ جدا) and تجاوزت الحد (exceeded limit) messages after only 5-7 interactions, and requested it be removed for customers with credit.
2.  **Admin Bot Unresponsiveness:** Admin bot buttons were not responding.
3.  **Category Deletion Failure:** Despite previous attempts and fixes, the user continued to report فشل في حذف الفئة (failed to delete category).
4.  **Open Bot from Website:** The user requested a feature to open the Telegram bot directly from the website, which should then open the Telegram Web App immediately.

The AI engineer acknowledged these issues, outlined a plan to address them, and started implementing fixes:
-   It modified  to adjust rate limiting logic, aiming to disable it for users with sufficient balance and exclude admin operations. The  function was likely targeted for this conditional rate limit application.
-   It also modified  to add the Open Telegram Bot button on the frontend, which is intended to redirect users.

The trajectory concludes with the AI deciding to call a , indicating that the combined complexity of the remaining issues, especially the persistent category deletion failure and general unresponsiveness, warranted specialized diagnostic assistance.
