The AI engineer's trajectory commenced with refining the Abod Shop (formerly Abod Card) Telegram bot and its associated Telegram Web App (TWA). Initial efforts focused on UI adjustments, payment system migration from Telegram Stars to a local dollar wallet, and integrating multi-step order fulfillment. Extensive user feedback drove subsequent tasks, including resolving bot unresponsiveness, implementing comprehensive search features across bot and TWA, and overhauling the TWA's UI/branding to a Cyber/Tech Aesthetic. Crucially, report generation was fixed, and critical backend code was optimized, removing duplicates and unused components. New features like guest user purchase flows, enhanced product details, and Telegram SEO were added. The current challenge is debugging why products aren't displaying on the custom-domain-hosted TWA, following a fix for a data loading error.

<product_requirements>
The Abod Shop is a Telegram bot and Web App for selling digital cards, aiming for a fast, modern Cyber/Tech Aesthetic. The TWA () must be the primary interface, displaying categorized products, featuring a functional purchase flow, and showing dollar wallet balance. Branding requires Abod Shop name, a specific logo (integrated, not just an image), and an electric blue/bright orange color scheme with neon/glow effects. Payment uses a local dollar wallet with admin-managed manual methods; TWA top-up requests redirect to the bot. Key features include multi-language support (Arabic/English), unique order numbers with admin search, and product/category search in both user bot and TWA. Admin bot requires full management, user/order search (with execute/cancel), a multi-step order completion process, and image-based report generation/sending. The bot also needs Telegram SEO, detailed product/category info displayed to users, a Menu Button/Mini App, and a guest purchase flow for non-Telegram users.

<code_architecture>

- ****: The core FastAPI backend handling all bot logic and APIs.
    - **Summary of importance:** Centralized control for user and admin bot interactions, product/category management, user/order handling, payment methods, report generation, and bot configuration.
    - **Summary of changes:**  fixes for report generation, removal of  model, extensive code cleanup (duplicate function removal like , ),  model enhanced with more details,  and  updated to display product details. Bot SEO meta-data (description, commands), webhook registration, rate limiting, and IP validation added.  endpoint for Menu Button/Mini App, hardcoded secrets moved to ,  block added. The  endpoint was removed.
- ****: The main Telegram Web App user interface.
    - **Summary of importance:** Provides the visual store experience for users within Telegram, displaying products, search, and purchase flow.
    - **Summary of changes:** UI colors extensively redesigned for a dark Cyber/Tech Aesthetic, removing white backgrounds and updating primary colors, text colors, product cards, and buttons. Logo integrated prominently, replacing text-based logo. Abod Card text replaced with Abod Shop. Guest user modal and related elements added. WhatsApp contact number updated.
- ****: Backend environment variables.
    - **Summary of importance:** Contains crucial configuration including bot tokens and database connection strings.
    - **Summary of changes:** , , and  were moved here or ensured to be correctly sourced from environment.
- ****: Python script using Pillow for generating image-based order reports.
    - **Summary of importance:** Essential for the new feature allowing users to receive visual order reports.
    - **Summary of changes:** Created and modified to include order details in the generated image report, though specific code changes in the trajectory mostly relate to its invocation.
- ****: (New) A copy of  intended for deployment on GitHub Pages.
    - **Summary of importance:** Serves as the static file for the custom domain hosted TWA.
    - **Summary of changes:** Created by copying . The  URL was corrected to point to the  directly, instead of inferring from , to resolve data loading issues on the custom domain. Guest user registration modal and related JavaScript functions were integrated.
- ****: (New) A temporary copy of the TWA for user download.
- ****: (New) A simple HTML page for facilitating the download of .
- **Other removed files/folders:** Numerous old deployment files, guides, and unused web resources (, , , etc.) were deleted to optimize codebase lightness.
- **New documentation files (.md):** Several new guides were created (, , , , , , , , ) to instruct the user on setup, features, and deployment.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement multi-language support (English portion).
- Implement performance testing with dummy data generation.
- Implement deletion of dummy users and orders from the admin bot.
- Enhance daily/monthly/yearly reports with filtering capabilities.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's report that the Telegram Web App (TWA) was not displaying client data (name, balance), products, or allowing orders when accessed via the custom GitHub Pages URL ().

The AI successfully diagnosed and fixed a critical issue: the  URL within  was incorrectly configured. It was using , which resulted in API calls being sent to  (a non-existent endpoint), instead of the correct backend URL (e.g., ). The AI corrected this by hardcoding the correct backend URL for  in the  file and preparing an updated file for the user to upload.

Following this fix, the user reported a new issue: المنتجات لم تظهر في الموقع (Products did not appear on the site). The AI engineer's immediate action was to verify that products are indeed available via the API, which they confirmed. The current focus is now on debugging the frontend rendering logic within  to understand why the fetched products are not being displayed to the user.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate the product rendering logic in  to fix the issue where products are not displayed, given that the backend API is confirmed to be providing product data.
